# Steel Surface Defect Detection

This project uses various machine learning models to detect surface defects in steel from structured tabular data. Models include Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost, and more.

## Files
- `steel_defect_detection.ipynb`: The main notebook with all analysis and modeling.
- `submission.csv`: Final submission file with predicted probabilities.

## Defect Categories
- Pastry
- Z_Scratch
- K_Scatch
- Stains
- Dirtiness
- Bumps
- Other_Faults

## Evaluation
ROC-AUC was used to evaluate model performance.
